### COVID-19 Data Analysis and Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 trends, predicts future cases and deaths, and explores the impact of vaccination on mortality. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and machine learning-based forecasting.
