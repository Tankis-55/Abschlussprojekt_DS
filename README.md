🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Forecasting

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 trends, predicts future cases and deaths, and explores the impact of vaccination on mortality. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and machine learning-based forecasting.

📊 Key Features
	•	📂 Data Cleaning & Processing
	•	Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data
	•	Converting date formats and extracting relevant features
	•	📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Statistical insights (mean, median, standard deviation)
	•	Data distribution and correlation analysis
	•	Seasonality effects on virus spread
	•	📈 Data Visualization
	•	Heatmaps, bar plots, pie charts, and scatter plots
	•	COVID-19 trend analysis across continents
	•	Vaccination vs. mortality impact analysis
	•	🤖 Machine Learning & Forecasting
	•	ARIMA-based time series forecasting (next 10 years)
	•	Predicting future COVID-19 cases and deaths
	•	Regression analysis on vaccination rates and infections

📂 Dataset
	•	Source: Kaggle’s COVID-19 dataset, WHO data, and government reports
	•	Format: CSV (compact_official_countries_only.csv)
	•	Key Columns:
	•	date: Date of record
	•	continent: Continent name
	•	total_cases: Cumulative COVID-19 cases
